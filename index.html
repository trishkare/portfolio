    <p>Hello, my name is Patricia Lubega and welcome to my <strong> Independent Project Portfolio.</strong></p>
    <p>I have been learing about coding in Moringa school for about a week now. Here are some of the links that I created with my partner while at Moringa School</p>

      Check out <a href="https://github.com/trishkare/my-pet-blog.git">My-pet-blog</a> This is my blog about my cats. I use html language.</
       Checkout <a href="https://github.com/trishkare/my-first-webpage.git">My-first_webpage</a> This was the first website I ever created. I also used html language.</
