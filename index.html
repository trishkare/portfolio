      <p>Hello, my name is Patricia Lubega and welcome to my <strong>Independent Project Portfolio.</strong></p>

    <h2>About me.</h2>
      <p>I am twenty years old. I currently hold my PPL and CPL License. My main reason for deciding to take a class in programing was because i wanted to gain at leaste basic skill in programing which i think will soon be a requirement in the 21st Century.</p>
      <p>I am currently a student at <em>Moringa School</em> taking a course called Moringa-prep. Moringa-prep takes five weeks.</p>
